## Who we are
DoLife AI, LLC (“**DoLife**”, “we”, “us”)  
Georgia, United States  
Contact: [support@dolife-ai.com](mailto:support@dolife-ai.com)

## Scope
This policy explains how we handle information when you use:
- The DoLife iOS app (task creation, assignment, reminders, sharing)
- Our website at app.dolife-ai.com (hosted via GitHub Pages)

> DoLife is **tasks-only**. It does **not** ingest your email, scan mailboxes, or connect to external calendars.

## What we collect
### Account & sign-in
- Email address (for magic-link sign-in)
- Apple/Google sign-in identifiers (identity only)

### In-app data you create
- Tasks and related fields (title, notes, due date/priority, recurrence, steps, created-by/date, notifications)
- Sharing relationships (e.g., family members you invite)
- Optional child labels (e.g., first-name badges you enter)
- Preferences

### Website
- No tracking pixels. GitHub Pages may set strictly-necessary cookies to serve the site.

### Diagnostics/analytics
- Not enabled at launch. If we add privacy-respecting analytics or crash reporting later, we’ll update this policy.

## How we use data
- Provide core features (auth, sync, sharing, notifications)
- Security/fraud prevention and support
- Communicating product changes or required notices

We **do not** sell personal data or share it for cross-context behavioral advertising.

## Processors we use
- **Supabase** (authentication, database, storage; row-level security)
- **Postmark** (transactional email for magic links)
- **Apple / Google** (OAuth for sign-in)
- **GitHub Pages** (website hosting)

## Data retention
- **Account & app data:** kept until you delete your account or content  
- **Server logs:** up to **30 days** (metadata only)  
- **Backups:** encrypted rolling backups up to **35 days**

## Your choices
- Delete your account by contacting [support@dolife-ai.com](mailto:support@dolife-ai.com); we’ll remove account data subject to legal/backup constraints (backups roll off within 35 days)
- Export/copy: request a copy of your task data via support

## Security
- Encryption in transit (TLS) and at rest (Supabase-managed)
- Row-Level Security (RLS), least-privilege access, access logging
- No method is perfectly secure; we work to improve continually

## Children
DoLife is for adults and individuals **13+**. Parents/caregivers may enter a child’s first name to organize tasks; we do not knowingly collect data directly from children under 13.

## International use
We primarily serve U.S. users and host data in U.S. regions. If we expand, we’ll update this policy.

## Incident notification
If a security incident materially affects your data, we will notify you without undue delay as required by law.

## Changes
We may update this policy. We’ll post updates here and adjust the “Last updated” date; for material changes we may also notify you in-app or by email.
