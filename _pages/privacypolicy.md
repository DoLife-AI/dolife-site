## Who we are
DoLife AI, LLC (“**DoLife**”, “we”, “us”)  
Georgia, United States  
Contact: [stephen@dolife-ai.com](mailto:stephen@dolife-ai.com)

## Scope
This policy explains how we handle information when you use:
- The DoLife iOS app (task creation, assignment, reminders, sharing)
- Our website at app.dolife-ai.com (hosted via GitHub Pages)

> DoLife is **tasks-only**. It does **not** ingest your email, scan mailboxes, or connect to external calendars.

## What we collect
### Account & sign-in
- Email address (for magic-link sign-in)
- Apple/Google sign-in identifiers (identity only)

### In-app data you create
- Tasks and related fields (title, notes, due date/priority, recurrence, steps, created-by/date, notifications)
- Sharing relationships (e.g., family members you invite)
- Optional child labels (e.g., first-name badges you enter)
- Preferences

### Website
- No tracking pixels. GitHub Pages may set strictly-necessary cookies to serve the site.

### Diagnostics/analytics
- Not enabled at launch. If we add privacy-respecting analytics or crash reporting later, we’ll update this policy.

## How we use data
- Provide core features (auth, sync, sharing, notifications)
- Security/fraud prevention and support
- Communicating product changes or required notices

We **do not** sell personal data or share it for cross-context behavioral advertising.

## Processors we use
- **Supabase** (authentication, database, storage; row-level security)
- **Postmark** (transactional email for magic links)
- **Apple / Google** (OAuth for sign-in)
- **GitHub Pages** (website hosting)

## Data retention
- **Account & app data:** We keep your account and task data while your account is active, until you delete your account or content, or we delete it as part of routine cleanup.
- **Server logs and diagnostics:** Our cloud providers keep limited technical logs for a short period (typically up to around a week) to help us keep the service secure and running.
- **Backups:** We don’t currently operate our own long-term backup system for task data. If you need your own copy of your tasks for backup or record-keeping, please use the export feature described below.


## Your choices
- **Delete your account:** You can delete your account from within the DoLife app (in More > Profile). Deletion removes your account and associated task data from our active database. Limited information may remain in system logs and email archives which are removed automatically over time.
- **Export your data:** You can export your task data from within the app (More → Export/Import).


## Security
- Encryption in transit (TLS) and at rest (Supabase-managed)
- Row-Level Security (RLS), least-privilege access, access logging
- A small number of authorized operators may access your data when necessary for support, debugging, or security, and we aim to use least-privilege access and logging where possible
- No method is perfectly secure; we work to improve continually

## Children
DoLife is for adults and individuals **13+**. Parents/caregivers may enter a child’s first name to organize tasks; we do not knowingly collect data directly from children under 13.

## International use
We primarily serve U.S. users and host data in U.S. regions. You can use DoLife from other countries, but your information will be processed in the United States, which may have different data-protection laws than your home country. If we begin hosting data in other regions, we’ll update this policy.

## Incident notification
If we become aware of a security incident that materially affects your data, we will notify you without undue delay as required by law (for example, by email or in-app notice).

## Changes
We may update this policy. We’ll post updates here and adjust the “Last updated” date; for material changes we may also notify you in-app or by email.
